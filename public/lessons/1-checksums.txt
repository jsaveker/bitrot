Lesson 1: What's a Checksum?
------------------------------

Imagine sending a message across a noisy room. Did they hear it right?
A checksum is like asking the receiver to add up all the numbers in the message and tell you the total.

If the total matches what *you* calculated, the message *probably* arrived okay.
If it doesn't match, something got scrambled!

Computers use complex math (like SHA-256 or MD5) to calculate a checksum (or 'hash') for files.
Storing this hash lets you verify later if the file has changed even by a single bit.

It's a basic defense against silent data corruption!
