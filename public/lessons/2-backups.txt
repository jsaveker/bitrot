Lesson 2: Backups - The Ultimate Defense
-----------------------------------------

Bit rot happens. Drives fail. Ransomware encrypts. Coffee spills.
What's your plan?

A backup is simply a *copy* of your important data stored *somewhere else*.

- **Simple:** Copy files to a USB drive.
- **Better:** Use backup software (Time Machine, Windows Backup) to automate copies to an external drive.
- **Best:** The 3-2-1 Rule:
    - **3** copies of your data
    - On **2** different types of media (e.g., internal drive + external drive)
    - With **1** copy stored off-site (e.g., cloud storage, drive at a friend's house).

Freezing a file here is like making a simple backup - it stops further changes (decay).
Real backups protect against *total loss*.
